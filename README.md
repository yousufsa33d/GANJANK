Our project is a Local Language Wikipedia Clone developed using the Django web framework. The aim of this application is to provide users with a platform to access Wikipedia articles in their native languages, thereby promoting inclusivity and enhancing knowledge dissemination across diverse linguistic communities. Leveraging the power of Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, we have built a feature-rich and user-friendly web application that allows contributors to create and edit content while ensuring a seamless user experience.

The Local Language Wikipedia Clone supports multiple languages, enabling users to browse and contribute articles in their preferred languages. The application dynamically serves content based on the user's language preference, ensuring that information is accessible to a broader audience.

User Authentication & Permissions:
To maintain data integrity and security, the application implements a robust user authentication system. Contributors and administrators can create accounts, log in securely, and have designated permissions to manage and edit articles. This ensures that only authorized users can make changes to the content.

The application incorporates a powerful search feature, enabling users to quickly find articles of interest. The search functionality is optimized to provide relevant and accurate results, enhancing the overall user experience.

Rich Text Editor:
Contributors can utilize a user-friendly rich text editor to create and edit articles effortlessly. The editor supports various formatting options, allowing contributors to customize the content with headings, lists, images, and hyperlinks.

Responsive User Interface:
We have designed the application's user interface using HTML and CSS to be responsive and compatible with different devices and screen sizes. Whether accessed from a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, users can enjoy a consistent and intuitive browsing experience.

Technologies Used:

Django: The core of the application, Django, handles URL routing, request handling, and database interactions. It ensures efficient data retrieval and manipulation, making the application performant and scalable.

Python: Python serves as the primary programming language for backend development, providing the logic and data processing capabilities required for the application's functionality.

HTML & CSS: The front-end design of the application is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
